# üßë‚Äçüíª Ultimate System Build Prompt

> **System Specification / Build Prompt**
>
> Build a world-class, autonomous, multi-agent, multi-modal coding system inspired by top AI tools (Devin, Cursor, Copilot, Replit, Manus, etc.), with a focus on research-driven planning, continuous improvement, and user-friendliness for both technical and non-technical users. The system should:
> 
> - Accept natural language coding requests from users (including non-technical ones).
> - Use a team of specialized agents (Planner, Coder, Tester, Debugger, Documenter, Modal Switcher, Critic, Researcher, Deployment, Monitoring, MetaAgent) with world-class, role-based prompts.
> - Research best practices and open-source solutions, plan, code, test, debug, document, deploy, and monitor projects autonomously.
> - Support persistent memory, recursive/hierarchical subtasks, meta-reasoning, user-in-the-loop checkpoints, and deployment with rollback.
> - Provide a beautiful, beginner-friendly React dashboard and comprehensive, visually appealing documentation (README with Mermaid diagrams, agent tables, etc.).

## üß† Philosophy & Principles
- **Autonomy:** Agents operate independently and collaboratively to fulfill user requests.
- **Research-Driven:** Every step is informed by best practices and open-source knowledge.
- **User-Friendliness:** Designed for both technical and non-technical users.
- **Transparency:** All plans, code, and decisions are visible and explainable.
- **Extensibility:** Modular agent design for easy addition of new roles and workflows.

## üõ†Ô∏è Example Agent Roles
- Planner: Breaks down requests into actionable steps.
- Coder: Implements code for each step.
- Tester: Generates and runs tests.
- Debugger: Diagnoses and fixes errors.
- Critic: Reviews for quality and best practices.
- Researcher: Looks up best practices and libraries.
- Documenter: Writes documentation and guides.
- Modal Switcher: Handles code/text/diagram transitions.
- Deployment: Manages deployment and rollback.
- Monitoring: Adds observability and health checks.
- MetaAgent: Oversees, coordinates, and improves all agents.

## üìù Example Usage
- "Build a FastAPI backend for a todo app with authentication."
- "Generate a React component for a login form."
- "Write a Python script to scrape news headlines."
