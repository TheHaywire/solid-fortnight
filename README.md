# üßë‚Äçüíª Multi-Agent Coding System

Welcome! This is a world-class, autonomous, multi-modal, multi-agent coding system inspired by Devin, Cursor, Copilot, Replit, Manus, and the open-source community. It is designed for both technical and non-technical users to research, plan, code, test, debug, document, deploy, and monitor software projects with ease.

## üîÑ Agent Workflow

```mermaid

    participant U as User
    participant F as Frontend
    participant B as Backend
    participant O as Orchestrator
    participant P as Planner
    participant C as Coder
    participant T as Tester
    participant D as Debugger
    participant CR as Critic
    participant DOC as Documenter

    U->>F: Submit coding request
    F->>B: Send request
    B->>O: Forward to orchestrator
    O->>P: Plan project steps
    P-->>O: Return plan
    O->>C: Generate code for each step
    C-->>O: Return code files
    O->>T: Generate and run tests
    T-->>O: Return test results

## üß† Persistent Memory & Context

The system maintains persistent memory for user preferences, project context, and past actions, enabling context-aware, personalized, and stateful agentic workflows.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Memory
        UserPrefs["User Preferences"]
        ProjectCtx["Project Context"]
        PastActions["Past Actions"]
    end
    Orchestrator --> Memory
    Memory --> Orchestrator
    User --> Orchestrator
    Orchestrator --> Agents
    Agents --> Orchestrator
    Memory -.-> Agents
    Agents -.-> Memory
    Memory -.-> Frontend
    Frontend -.-> Memory
```

## üß¨ Meta-Reasoning & Recursive Subtasks

The MetaAgent oversees all agents, spawns recursive/hierarchical subtasks, selects the best agent for each job, and continuously improves the workflow through feedback loops.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph MetaReasoning
        MetaAgent["MetaAgent"]
        SubtaskGen["Subtask Generator"]
        AgentSelector["Agent Selector"]
        FeedbackLoop["Self-Improvement Loop"]
    end
    Orchestrator --> MetaAgent
    MetaAgent --> SubtaskGen
    MetaAgent --> AgentSelector
    MetaAgent --> FeedbackLoop
    SubtaskGen --> Agents
    AgentSelector --> Agents
    FeedbackLoop --> Orchestrator
    FeedbackLoop --> Agents
```

## üö¢ Deployment & Monitoring Workflow

Automated deployment and monitoring are handled by specialized agents, ensuring safe rollouts, observability, and rapid rollback if needed.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    User["User"]
    Frontend["Frontend (React Dashboard)"]
    Backend["Backend (FastAPI)"]
    Orchestrator["Orchestrator"]
    Deployment["Deployment Agent"]
    Monitoring["Monitoring Agent"]
    Cloud["Cloud/Server/Target"]
    Alerts["Monitoring Dashboard/Alerts"]

    User --> Frontend
    Frontend --> Backend
    Backend --> Orchestrator
    Orchestrator --> Deployment
    Deployment --> Cloud
    Cloud --> Monitoring
    Monitoring --> Alerts
    Alerts --> User
```
